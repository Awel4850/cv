                <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always loved to help people. 
                    I used that passion in my role as an emergency dispatcher for the American
                    Red Cross,which put me in a team of like-minded individuals who shared 
                    the same desire and collaborated to assist individuals and 
                    families displaced by natural disasters. During my time there, 
                    I mentored many volunteers and paid staff on the ins and outs of the 
                    day-to-day functions of the Emergency Commination Center at the Red 
                    Cross. My leadership in mentoring has gotten to the point where I was an 
                    active participant in the orientation process, and a brief video of me 
                    describing my experience is shown to any new dispatcher, whether volunteer 
                    or paid staff, is shown to this day.
